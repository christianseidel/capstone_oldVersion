## My Capstone Project

From January to April 2022 I am attending a Full Stack Java Development Bootcamp with "neue fische" in Hamburg. This is my Capstone Project.

## SmartCount App
SmartCount is a group app. It offers an easy way to keep track of everybody's expenses and allows to quickly see each person's share of costs and due at any point in time. SmartCount is meant for people who go on vacation together, live in a shared apartment, or simply plan for the next big event to take place. As a member of the group you will only have access to your own expense items.

## Tech Stack
The Project is based on Java 17 and TypeScript, and includes elements of HTML and CSS. When building the app the following technologies have been integrated or used: Spring Web, REST, JSON, React Router, Spring Security, JWT, JUnit/Mockito, Maven, MongoDB, Heroku. Since I worked as a professional translator for many years, I could not do without React I18N-Next.

**Please beware:** As I wrote these lines, I was still in the process of coding the app. It will only be finalized at the end of April 2022.
